# Automating-File-Renaming
This project automates the renaming of a bunch of files in a directory based on a specific rule.

What it does:

Takes a directory path and a renaming rule as input.
Loops through all the files in the directory.
Applies the renaming rule to each filename and renames the file.
Example Renaming Rule:

Add a prefix "2024_" to all files.
Libraries you'll need:

os: This library provides functions for interacting with the operating system, like getting file names and paths.

Replace "/path/to/your/directory" with the path to the directory containing the files you want to rename. Also, adjust the prefix variable according to the renaming rule you want to apply.
